NAME
    YAML2 - Next Generation YAML Tools For Perl

DESCRIPTION
    YAML2 is a backwards compatible rewrite of YAML.pm. When YAML2 is done
    and stable, the code will be duplicated as YAML.pm, and YAML2 will be
    deprecated. At that point, you can simply "s/YAML2/YAML/g" in your code,
    and everything will work out.

    YAML2 includes pure Perl code and Extensions of libyaml.

    NOTE: Currently this module does nothing useful, but is being uploaded
    to CPAN early and often to generate visibility and discussion.
