NAME
    YAML2 - Next Generation YAML Tools For Perl

DESCRIPTION
    YAML2 is a backwards compatible rewrite of YAML.pm. When YAML2 is done
    and stable, the code will be duplicated as YAML.pm, and YAML2 will be
    deprecated. At that point, you can simply "s/YAML2/YAML/g" in your code,
    and everything will work out.

    YAML2 includes pure Perl code and Extensions of libyaml.

    NOTE: This implementation now has a rudimentary binding to libyaml
    (YAML2::LibYaml) that seems to work for plain hashes, arrays and
    scalars. This should cover all of JSON since JSON is a strict subset of
    YAML.
